take a newspaper.
take some scissors.
choose from this paper an article the length you want to make your poem.
cut out the article.
next carefully cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them all in a bag.
shake gently.
next take out each cutting one after the other.
copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
the poem will resemble you.
and there you are - an infinitely original author of charming sensibility,
even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.

inspired by that i wrote a piece of c++ code that would cut up, mix and randomly place the words for you :)
